OpenBullet 2 is a cross platform automation suite powered by .NET core. It allows to perform requests towards a target webapp and offers a lot of tools to work with the results. This software can be used for **scraping** and **parsing data**, automated **pentesting** and much more.

This is a **modified** version of the original OpenBullet! This was not originally made by me! (dinxks)
