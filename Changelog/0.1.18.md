Changelog for version 0.1.18

- Improved exception message in safe mode (now includes the exception type)
- Fixed errors in DataPoolFactoryService when files are missing (now falls back to infinite data pool)
- Added custom formats to Zip block

This update is fixing a game breaking bug introduced in 0.1.17 so I had to push it ASAP.
