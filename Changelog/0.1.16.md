Changelog for version 0.1.16

- Implemented async locks. You can find a sample use case [here](https://discourse.openbullet.dev/t/global-session-token-that-refreshes/2854)
- Fixed game breaking bug in auto-blocks that use dictionaries
- Removed error on invalid cookies sent from the server

This is a very small update but it's fixing a game breaking bug introduced in 0.1.15 so I had to push it ASAP.
